*** Gof

GOF is an experimental ad-hoc program I developed to address a common
problem I often encounter while using the terminal. Frequently, I run
commands like eslint or rg, which produce output containing file paths
along with line and column numbers. I needed a quick way to extract
and gather those file paths efficiently.

GOF takes the output of these commands as standard input (stdin) and
generates a list of the files present in the output.

For instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ pnpm lint  | gof
  /path/to/file:10:35 error description
  /path/to/file2:10:35 error description
  /path/to/file3:10:35 error description
#+END_SRC

In my workflow, GOF proves valuable because I can directly capture the
output of the last command (thanks to Kitty, my terminal emulator) and
pass it to gof. The result from GOF can then be sent to a script that
opens Vim and populates the quickfix list with the extracted file
paths.

*** Very experimental

It's an ad-hoc solution for **my** workflow and is very
experimental. See the /samples folder to check what kind of outputs
it's able to parse
